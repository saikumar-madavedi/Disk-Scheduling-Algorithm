                    <h3>Seek Time</h3> <br>
                    <p>Seek time is the time taken in locating the disk arm to a specified track where the read/write
                        request will be satisfied.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Rotational Latency</h3> <br>
                    <p>It is the time taken by the desired sector to rotate itself to the position from where it can
                        access the R/W heads.</p>

                    <p>It is the time taken to transfer the data.</p>

                <div class="card1">
                    <h3>Disk Access Time</h3> <br>
                    <p>Disk access time is given as,
                        Disk Access Time = Rotational Latency + Seek Time + Transfer Time</p>

            <h2>Various Disk Scheduling Algorithms</h2>
            <div id="first">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>First Come First Serve (FCFS)</h3> <br>
                    <p>FCFS is the simplest disk scheduling algorithm. As the name suggests, this algorithm entertains
                        requests in the order they arrive in the disk queue. The algorithm looks very fair and there is
                        no starvation (all requests are serviced sequentially) but generally, it does not provide the
                        fastest service.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)</h3> <br>
                    <p>Shortest seek time first (SSTF) algorithm selects the disk I/O request which requires the least
                        disk arm movement from its current position regardless of the direction. It reduces the total
                        seek time as compared to FCFS. It allows the head to move to the closest track in the service
                        queue.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>SCAN</h3> <br>
                    <p>In SCAN disk scheduling algorithm, head starts from one end of the disk and moves towards the
                        other end, servicing requests in between one by one and reach the other end. Then the direction
                        of the head is reversed and the process continues as head continuously scan back and forth to
                        access the disk.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="second">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Circular Scan (C-Scan)</h3> <br>
                    <p>Circular SCAN (C-SCAN) scheduling algorithm is a modified version of SCAN disk scheduling
                        algorithm that deals with the inefficiency of SCAN algorithm by servicing the requests more
                        uniformly. Like SCAN (Elevator Algorithm) C-SCAN moves the head from one end servicing all the
                        requests to the other end.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>LOOK</h3> <br>
                    <p>The LOOK algorithm services request similarly as SCAN algorithm meanwhile it also “looks” ahead
                        as if there are more tracks that are needed to be serviced in the same direction. If there are
                        no pending requests in the moving direction the head reverses the direction and start servicing
                        requests in the opposite direction.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Circular Look</h3> <br>
                    <p>In this algorithm, the head services requests only in one direction until all the requests in
                        this direction are not serviced and then jumps back to the farthest request on the other
                        direction and service the remaining requests which gives a better uniform servicing as well as
                        avoids wasting seek time for going till the end of the disk.</p>
